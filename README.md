# ghost_specutils
Tools for working with reduced GHOST spectra

## plotting_ghost_spectra.ipynb

Jupyter notebook for plotting GHOST spectra either order-by-order or the combined and interpolated spectra, and a script for plotting and saving a full GHOST spectrum to a single pdf

## combine_ghost_spec.ipynb

Jupyter notebook for reading in and combining multiple exposures of GHOST spectra and plotting the combined spectra or their S/N

## combine_ghost_spec_fix_clocking.ipynb

Jupyter notebook that expands on combine_ghost_spec.ipynb to read in multiple spectra and correct the wavelength solutions for an issue in the binned data that isn't properly treated in GHOSTDR yet
